`kafka-chess` is a project that builds a **web-based chess game** with _real-time analytics_. Players interact with an _interactive chessboard_ via a web application, where every move and game event is published to a _Kafka event bus_. An _Apache Flink engine_ continuously processes these events to calculate live game statistics, which are then displayed on a dynamic _Streamlit dashboard_.
