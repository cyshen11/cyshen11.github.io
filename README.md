# Vincent Cheng Yun Sheng's Portfolio Website

I'm a data scientist. I was born in Malaysia, but currently living in Singapore. I graduated with Mechanical Engineering bachelor degree and currently pursuing a MS in Analytics (Online/Part-time).

I began my career as an engineering assistant in the manufacturing industry, working on various projects, including project management, product deployment, automated vision systems, and product packaging.

After a year in the same role, I got the opportunity to develop dashboards. I started by creating dashboards to monitor production throughput, order fill rates, and inventory space.

Three years into my first job, I decided to transition to a data analytics team. This move was a turning point that set me on the data science career path.

Since then, I’ve worked in the aerospace, insurance, and supply chain industries. Some of my projects include time-series forecasting, natural language processing (NLP), analytics dashboards, image recognition, and building chatbots.
